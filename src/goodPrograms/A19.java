// Finding Determinant of a Matrix . 3Ã—3 

/**
 * LOGIC :: 1. GET THE NUMBER OF ROWS ANS COLUMNS IN THE MATRIX {R & C} 2.
 * ASSUME PROCEEDING VIA COLUMNS { WHILE FINAL CALCULATIONS FOR EVEN USE +ve AND
 * -ve FOR ODD COLUMNS} 3. MAKE A FUNCTION THAT TAKES THE COLOUMN'S FIRST NUMBER
 * AND CREATE A NEW MATRIX BY ELIMINATING ITS ROW AND COL - how to eliminate r &
 * c ? ans : take the index from both sides{row and col} , of that particular
 * number picked up , then iterate in the main array fully each element checking
 * that if that's random number's index matches the main number's index from
 * both sides 2-d if matches then do not add it in a new array else add it 4. U
 * WILL HAVE A MATRIX AT LAST OF THIS AND THEN IN THE SAME FXN DO CALCULATIONS
 * CROSS MULTIPLICATION OF ARRAY AND RETURN THE INT VALUE ,also at at last u may
 * even multiply the initial number also to final calculation with sign {initial
 * num : first no. of that col which was used } 5. THEN MAKE A FINAL CALCULATION
 * FXN WHERE ADD ALL THE INT'S and show the result .
 * 
 * example : [1,2,3], [4,9,6], [7,0,9] det = 81+12 take the first element of
 * main array take 1 : its row index = outer array index = 0 its column index =
 * inner arr = 0 now iterate via each element using nested for loops , get
 * further if element is viable to be added then add it to new array solve the
 * cross multuply of the new array , multiply it with 1 { main col element }
 * with sign + /- on odd even col
