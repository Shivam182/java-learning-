// Reversing A string in java :
// Ans:- METHOD 1 : by reversing a chars array

// METHOD 2 : further that can be done with collections.reverseorddeer method

//  METHOD 3 : or u can use simple array elements swapping but remember not to do this directly one by one each element from 1st to end 
// coz when u reach he last element the arrays 1st element would have been already same as last element not its original numebr 
// coz it had been chnaged at the start only . and soo on for some other inner elements also . 
// NOTE : DO MANUAL ARRAY REVERSAL BY SWAPPING NUMBER IN PAIRS OF SAME INDEXES FROM 1ST AND LAST .
// -USE AUXILARY VARIBLE OR TEMP VARIABLE FOR SWAPPING OR U MAY ALSO USE AN AUXILLARY ARRAY 

// METHOD 4 : PASS UR STRING TO STRING BUILDER CLASS AND THIS CLASS HAS REVERSE METHOD .
